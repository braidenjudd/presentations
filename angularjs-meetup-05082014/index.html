		# E2E testing of JavaScript with JavaScript
		*Protractor JS*

		---

		class: inverse

		## What kind of tests do you get the most value from?

		http://braiden.firebaseapp.com

		---

		# Why would we do E2E testing?

		* Testing the application as a user, not a computer
		* Backend v Frontend
		* Have I created a useful change, can I release this code?
		* E2E testing replaces unit testing (JOKE!)

		---

		# Why is E2E testing hard?

		* You need an environment, need working parts
		* Very hard to debug
		* Sloooooooooooow
		* Tests, generally have to be up to date with the layout. Hard to keep up to date.

		# What is Protractor JS?

		* Screenshot - of contributions

		???

		# Installation

		```
		---

		# Now you need a configuration file

		---

		# Agenda

		1. Introduction
		2. Deep-dive
		3. ...

		[NOTE]: Note that you need remark.js alongside this html file, but no internet connection.

		# Introduction

		# Mention about learning don't know what you don't know. This isn't a lecture or a sit down course. Designed to ge you excited about the capability. Controllers, Views, services. Then talk to someone RE: directives...

		# Not and expert. 5/10

		# Do Picks

		Why does it 

		---

		Context switching

		---

		WebdriverJs

		---

		Some sort of coding competition question???

		---

		Meta, Unit tests v E2E tests

		---

		Installation

		---

		Configuration File


		---

		Interactive mode

		---

		Shortcut notation

		

		---

		Multi browser

		--- 

		Going a bit Meta, but tests can and should be used as documentation, so the easier to read they are the better they are.
