		# E2E testing of JavaScript with JavaScript
		*Protractor JS*

		---

		class: inverse

		## What kind of tests do you get the most value from?

		http://braiden.firebaseapp.com

		---

		# Why would we do E2E testing?

		### Gaining confidence your application works

		???

		* Testing the application as a user, not a computer
		* Backend v Frontend. Do they work together nicely?
		* Have I created a useful change, can I release this code?
		* E2E testing does replaces unit testing

		---

		# Why is E2E testing hard?

		* You need an environment, need working parts
		* Very hard to debug
		* Sloooooooooooow
		* Tests, generally have to be up to date with the layout. Hard to keep up to date.

		---

		# What is Protractor JS?

		* Screenshot - of contributions

		???

		---

		class: center

		# What makes up Protractor JS 

		Built on WebdriverJS

		---

		# Why is it good to write tests in JavaScript?

		Context switching


		---

		# Built for Angular JS



		* Protractor understands angular
		* Angular gives your page structure
		* Protractor understands, templates and the dependency injection


		---

		# Differencs with the Angular Scenario Runner

		* More control over the browser
		* Same, high level integration with Angular
		* Does not run in an iframe you have to manage youself.

		---

		# Installation

		```
		npm install -g protractor
		```

		---

		# Setup

		```
		webdriver-manager update
		webdriver-manager start
		```

		## Congratulations you have a webdriver server up and running

		---

		# Bonus - Protractor with a Proxy

		## webdriver-manager does not work with a proxy

		* Download the webdrive jar and chromedriver.exe manually
		* Match the versions (DO NOT JUST GET THE LATEST!)
		* Copy to the angular locations
		* Happy Days

		---

		# Sauce Labs

		---

		# Allows you to write tests in Jasmine

		* Use the same notation as your unit tests
		* Patched to understand angular and async (waitForAngular())
		* See: https://github.com/angular/protractor/issues/909

		---

		# What does it not do well?

		* Not angular parts are still hard
		* Setup and teardown of database data
		* Keen to see what others have done here

		---

		# Now you need a configuration file

		---

		# Agenda

		1. Introduction
		2. Deep-dive
		3. ...

		[NOTE]: Note that you need remark.js alongside this html file, but no internet connection.
		---

		# Introduction

		# Mention about learning don't know what you don't know. This isn't a lecture or a sit down course. Designed to ge you excited about the capability. Controllers, Views, services. Then talk to someone RE: directives...

		---

		Why does it 


		---

		WebdriverJs

		---

		Some sort of coding competition question???

		---

		Meta, Unit tests v E2E tests

		---

		Installation

		---

		Configuration File

		* onPrepare

		---

		# Interactive mode/ Element Explorer

		* Show browser is real
		* Something that does not exist - show easy to comprehend error message
		* Something that does exist - getText(), click() etc.

		---

		Shortcut notation

		---

		# ```element()``` and ```element.all()```

		---

		Angular binding 

		* by.binding
		* by.model
		* by.repeater
		* by.css

		---

		Multi browser

		--- 

		Going a bit Meta, but tests can and should be used as documentation, so the easier to read they are the better they are.
		---

		Page objects

		* Split the information about how to interact with the page from the test logic
		* Can just require 
		* http://martinfowler.com/bliki/PageObject.html
