# Principles
 	- very very small - 100 lines of code
 	- loosely coupled
 	- multi-version ok
 		- multi copies of the data? ok. 
 		- 1% of the time you will need a single copy of the data.
 	- monitor yourself
	 	- publish when someone asks you to do something stupid
		- replaces, unit testing?
		- publish interesting stuff
		- Application - becomes a small conceptualization
 	- Everything about going fast

# Types of data

## Rapids
  - putting every event - log everything to the bus
  - central point of the application

## River
  - themed events

## Ponds
  - state/history
  - go from events -> entities

# Event buses

## Kafka
	- persistence store, crash safe - for rapids
	- publish all interesting events

## Central bus
	- debug, because you have event interesting event in order 

## 0mq
	- Use other Queues to create rivers - themed/filtered message queues

## Service
	- Publish to rapid
	- Subscribe to river

## Asynchronous Services
	- Services publish needs
	- Services listen and publish solutions
	- Original service listen and choose solution
	- Benefits
		- Variants east
		- Graceful degradation

# Service Types
## Needs processing
	- Solution services
	- Enrichment services - Add value to a solution
	- Solution Blocker - do not make her an offer
	- Client Biases - Modify solutions with extra data, 
	- Transactional services
	- Logging services

## Solution Selection

## Channel Interfaces
	- Client
	- Solution maker

## Logging and monitoring services

Questions
	- Why do IT people say no, are we ignoring past lessons.
 	- What is the response when we talk about one single bus?
 		- Buses are very scalable, deisgned for this purpose
	- Added complexity of the application

# Capital One - effect
	- Daily mail 130k J2EE to 4K Clojure
	- Uptick functions
		- Functional Programming -> suits microservices -> node.js
		- Dev/Ops
		- Continuous delivery
		- Mobile first
		- Cloud based Deployment

AGILE
	- Inititives
	- Projects
	- Features - Customer interaction here
	- Stories
	- Task

Micro service mantra
	- Speed over ???
	- Monitoring over testing
	- Working code over standards
	- It's a social change

Cultural
	- Experimentation drives innovation
	- Innovation occurs of discomfort
	- "Perfect" is the enemy of "Good"
	- Do, don't ask for permission

### Other notes
	- Baysian service principles
	- Services become disposable
	- Language agnostic
	- Design: events not enitities
	- History of events, not the current (Immutable Data)

Chad Fowler
	- Use sync
		- algorithms described serially
		- Programmers understanding
	- Point-2-Point RESTFUL
Fred
	- Async
		- Robust
	- Better de-coupling
	- Event bus

Functional Programming v Microservices
	- maps -> maps -> maps -> maps
		- intermediate data steps, why publish?

Databases
	- how #?
	- Entity v Polygot
