		### Part I: Intro
		### Part II: Benefits
		### Part III: Cultural Considerations
		### Part IV: Types of Microservice Architectures

		# Part I: Introduction
		*OK, what?*

		---

		## Let's start with a definition

		![Alt text](img/microservices.png)

		???

		* Loosely Coupled/Highly Cohesive
		* LOOSELY COUPLED, HIGHLY COHESIVE
		* SMALL, 1000 lines. APP FRAMEWORKS HELP
		* PEERS WORKING TOGETHER

		---

		## Core Principles

		### Loosely Coupled/Highly Cohesive
		### Small
		### Multi-Version OK
		### Favour Monitoring over Testing
		### It's a Cultural Thing
		### Everything is about going fast
		### It is a tool

		---

		class: inverse

		# Part II: Benefits
		*OK, why?*

		???

		* So now we have a definition, why would we want to do something like this?

		---

		## Brings freedom and choice

		### Empowerment

		![Alt text](img/lego.png)

		???

		* GIVES MORE FREEDOM AND CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGY
		* TRY NEW TECH WITH LESS RISK
		* ALLOWS TO HIRE PEOPLE TO SOLVE PROBLEMS NOT AS A JAVA DEV

		---

		## Scalability

		### Flexibility in Scaling

		![Alt text](img/finegrainedscalability.png)

		---

		## Agility

		### Architecture that fits the way you work

		![Alt text](img/agility.png)

		???

		* AGILE MANIFESTO - TRIAL, MEASURE, LEARN, CORRECT, REPEAT
		* DEPLOY PARTS INDIVIDUALLY, BECAUSE LOOSELY COUPLED
		* NEW PAYMENT TECH

		---

		## Resiliency

		### Cloud native architecture

		![Alt text](img/resiliency.png)

		???

		* HANDLE FAILURE, ISOLATED, LOOSELY COUPLED
		* CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE DEGRADED NOT REMOVED

		---

		## Geography

		### Distributed Workforce

		![Alt text](img/geography.png)

		???

		* DISTRIBUTED AGILE IS HARD
		* HAVE TEAMS DISTRIBUTED AS YOU PLAN TO DISTRIBUTE YOUR APPLICATION
		* SEARCH FOR TALENT MORE PLACES

		---

		class: inverse

		# Part III: Cultural Considerations
		*Ok, how?*

		---

		## Technical Considerations

		### Transactions

		![Alt text](img/transactions.png)

		---

		## Technical Considerations

		### Shared Data

		---

		## Technical Considerations

		### Service 'MESHING'

		---

		## Cultural Considerations

		### Embrace Conways Law

		> "organizations which design systems ... are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations" 
		> 
		> M. Conway

		???

		- If you create once be large team, you will get one big bit of software
		- If you embrace Conways Law and create teams around the services you want to build, you can let conways law take care of your architecture

		## Cultural Considerations

		## Cultural Considerations

		### Codependent v Independent

		![Alt text](img/dependence.png)

		## Cultural Considerations

		### Comfortable with Different Concepts

		???

		- Monitoring over testing

		# Take aways

		### Loosely coupled and highly cohesive
		### Small, well defined and limited to a single business concept
		### Standardise the pipes and connectors, allow autonomy in the service implementations
		### Logging is important, aggregate to create and end-to-end picture of your application
		### Standardise the deployment process, deploy often and quickly
		### Understand how team structure can impact your application

		# About Me

		### Cyclist
		### Quadcopters
		### Dogs

		???

		* Avid cyclist
		* Quadcopters, nothing stimilates boyish enthusiasm in me like Quadcopters, it is grown up lego. Would love to build an API on my two quadcopters and get them to work together.
