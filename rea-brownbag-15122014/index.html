		## What do you think of Microservices?

		class: inverse, center, middle

		# Agenda

		### Part I: Intro
		### Part II: Benefits
		### Part III: Cultural Considerations
		### Part IV: Types of Microservice Architectures

		---

		class: inverse, center, middle

		# Part I: Introduction
		*OK, what?*

		---

		class: center, middle

		## Let's start with a definition

		![Alt text](img/microservices.png)

		???

		* Loosely Coupled/Highly Cohesive
		* LOOSELY COUPLED, HIGHLY COHESIVE
		* SMALL, 1000 lines. APP FRAMEWORKS HELP
		* PEERS WORKING TOGETHER

		---

		# Core Principles

		- Loosely Coupled/Highly Cohesive
		- Small
		- Multi-Version OK
		- Favour Monitoring over Testing
		- It's a Cultural Thing
		- Everything is about going fast
		- Deployments should be unceremonious
		- It is a tool

		---

		class: inverse, center, middle

		# Part II: Benefits
		*OK, why?*

		???

		* So now we have a definition, why would we want to do something like this?

		---

		class: center, middle

		## Brings freedom and choice

		### Empowerment

		![Alt text](img/lego.png)

		???

		* GIVES MORE FREEDOM AND CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGY
		* TRY NEW TECH WITH LESS RISK
		* ALLOWS TO HIRE PEOPLE TO SOLVE PROBLEMS NOT AS A JAVA DEV

		---

		class: center, middle

		## Scalability

		### Flexibility in Scaling

		![Alt text](img/finegrainedscalability.png)

		---

		class: center, middle

		## Agility

		### Architecture that fits the way you work

		![Alt text](img/agility.png)

		???

		* AGILE MANIFESTO - TRIAL, MEASURE, LEARN, CORRECT, REPEAT
		* DEPLOY PARTS INDIVIDUALLY, BECAUSE LOOSELY COUPLED
		* NEW PAYMENT TECH

		---

		class: center, middle

		## Resiliency

		### Cloud native architecture

		![Alt text](img/resiliency.png)

		???

		* HANDLE FAILURE, ISOLATED, LOOSELY COUPLED
		* CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE DEGRADED NOT REMOVED

		---

		class: center, middle

		## Geography

		### Distributed Workforce

		![Alt text](img/geography.png)

		???

		* DISTRIBUTED AGILE IS HARD
		* HAVE TEAMS DISTRIBUTED AS YOU PLAN TO DISTRIBUTE YOUR APPLICATION
		* SEARCH FOR TALENT MORE PLACES

		---

		class: inverse, center, middle

		# Part III: Cultural Considerations
		*Ok, how?*

		---

		class: center, middle

		## Cultural Considerations

		### Embrace Conways Law

		> "organizations which design systems ... are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations" 
		> 
		> M. Conway

		???

		- If you create once be large team, you will get one big bit of software
		- If you embrace Conways Law and create teams around the services you want to build, you can let conways law take care of your architecture

		## Cultural Considerations

		### Codependent v Independent

		![Alt text](img/dependence.png)

		class: inverse, center, middle

		# Part IV: Types of Microservices
		*Restful v Event?*

		---

		class: center, middle

		## Breaking down the Monolith

		![Alt text](img/monolithic.png)

		class: inverse

		# Object Orientated v Functional Programing

		.left-column[
			<h2>OO</h2>
			<h3>Encapsulation</h3>
			<h3>Loosely Couple/Highly Cohesive</h3>
			<h3>Inheritance</h3>
		]
		.right-column[
			<h2>Functional</h2>
			<h3>Everything is a stream</h3>
			<h3>Generator - Creates data</h3>
			<h3>Map - Transforms data</h3>
			<h3>Filter - Remove unwanted data</h3>
			<h3>Reduce - Aggreagtes/Summarises data</h3>
		]

		---

		class: inverse

		# Resful v Eventing

		.left-column[
			<h2>Restful</h2>
			<h3>Encapsulisation - Interface hides the implementation of the service</h3>
			<h3>Loosely Couple/Highly Cohesive</h3>
			<h3>Inheritance - Services can call other child services for data</h3>
		]
		.right-column[
			<h2>Functional</h2>
			<h3>Large Stream of data</h3>
			<h3>Generator Services - add needs to the stream</h3>
			<h3>Mapping Services - publish solutions </h3>
			<h3>Filter Services - Create substreams to breakdown application</h3>
			<h3>Aggregator Services - Aggreagtes solutions back to client</h3>
		]

		## Restful

		### Overview

		![Alt text](img/microservices.png)

		---

		class: inverse

		# Restful

		## Types of Services

		### Data - Get/Generate Data
		### Mutator - Performs a Transaction
		### Transformation - Transforms data
		### Logging and Monitoring

		---

		class: inverse

		# Restful

		## Considerations

		### Transactions
		### Shared Data
		### Service 'MESHING'

		---

		class: center, middle

		## Eventing

		### Overview

		![Alt text](img/eventing.png)

		---

		class: center, middle

		## Eventing

		### Types of Data Streams

		![Alt text](img/eventing_data.png)

		---

		class: inverse

		# Eventing

		## Types of Services

		### Needs Generators
		### Solution Generators
		### Solution Aggregators
		### Sinks

		---

		class: inverse

		# Eventing

		## Considerations

		### Message Design
		### Event Bus Selection

		---

		class: inverse

		# Eventing

		## Considerations - Message Design

		```javascript
		{
			timeout: 10000,
			type: 'Need',
			solutions: []
		}
		```

		---

		class: inverse

		# Eventing

		## Considerations - Event Bus Selection

		### Need something that can scale, resilient (SPOF)
		### Kinesis/Lambda
		### http://kafka.apache.org/

		# Code Example

		## https://github.com/braidenjudd/microservices-by-example/

		---

		class: inverse

		# Take aways

		### Loosely coupled and highly cohesive
		### Small services
		### Deployments must be unceremonious
		### Understand how team structure can impact your application
		### Know the difference between eventing style and restful
