		# Agenda

		1. Benefits
		2. Deep-dive
		3. ...

		???

		I need to say what I want the audience to get out of the talk by the end.

		*Never heard of it? Have the drive to go out and see what it is about
		*I know it a little, maybe have a bit more of an idea on how it might help and how they can get started
		*If they are an expert they have seen what another person

		# Let's start with a definition

		What is a microservice?

		---

		# Some examples

		1. Next purchase recomendation engine in a book store
		2. Cost reporting engine for cloud resources
		3. 

		---

		# So we agree a smaller more lightweight service is better? Why not a nanoservice or even picoservice?

		---

		# Well the benefits of segregating and isolation are negated by management overhead and interservice communication

		---

		# Brings freedom and choice

		1. Geography
		2. Technology Stack
		3. Durability ??? What does that mean??
		4. Empowerment

		???

		* Empowerment - Services solves a problem that can be owned by a team or a group. Empowering them to solve the problem how they want, we just ditate the interface
		* Easy to enable new technology, we can trial new technologies on lesser services (in terms of complexity of the problems they solve). Enables you to hire people to solve problems not for their knowledge of a technology stack.
		* Scalability of innovation and product delivery. Teams are no longer planning independent changes, rather they can define the interface to their service and build changes within those bounds without the knowledge or the service customers.

		---

		# Agility

		???

		* The original AGILE manifesto was focused on trial, measure and correction. Microservices is an obvious fit for that working model as you can trial new technologies, ways of working, ide's hosting. Measure the results learn and feed into the next service. 

		---

		# Why more resiliant

		??? 

		* Services that are loosely coupled can continue even while one of their peers has failed. A great example of this is the Netflix

		# But what about scalability?

		???

		Perhaps but we can scale a lot better in a microservices world, we can scale the 'hot' services rather than just scale the whole thing. It also helps with DB scaling, DB scaling can be hard however in a small fine grained architecture persistance layers are rarely so large scaling becomes a major issue.

		---

		# Why more robust?

		---

		# Conways law???

		---

		# OK this is excellent but if everything is autonomous and not consistent how do we not end with multiple disparate systems they don't mesh together to create something useful for a human?

		* Interfaces - REST, Error Handling
		* Monitoring - Logging as a proactive and reactive tool, getting response times. Knowing what normal is.
		* Deployment
		* Transactions - Distributed Transactions

		---



		# Things to note from deployment

		---

		# Orchestrating services to make something useful

		- Important to define the interfaces between them, not necessarily the technology that supports them.
